Interest\\n• On a monthly basis, you would be required to repay the principal amount of the loan and interest on the loan at the rate as set out \\nin the agreement.\\n• Interest on your loan accrues on a daily basis on the total outstanding balance on that day, and is compounded and will be payable \\nmonthly on EMI dates as mentioned in point No 4 herein.\\n• If your Equated Monthly Instalment (EMI) date falls on a Sunday/public holiday, your interest will be calculated inclusive of that \\nday and debited on the next working day.\\n• The interest rate on the Floating Rate Loan which is linked to HSBC’s published Repo Linked Lending Rate (RLLR) will undergo \\nre-pricing (i.e. upwards or downwards as the case may be) in line with the movement of the RLLR. Repo rate is normally reviewed \\nby the Monetary Policy Committee at intervals of two months. In case of change in Policy Repo Rate, RLLR will be changed in the \\nbeginning of the following month (by 7th calendar day of the following month).

The RLLR is published by HSBC at the beginning of every month, which \\nwill be the benchmark rate for loans that are disbursed in that month.\\n• The ﬂoating rate of interest on all the loans linked to RLLR disbursed by HSBC will be reset on the month following the \\nannouncement by RBI on change of policy repo rate. The reset will be done by the 7th calendar day of the month. (refer to the \\nexample below).\\nExample:\\nA RLLR Linked Home Loan disbursed during Month 1 will be benchmarked against the RLLR of Month 1. The policy repo rate is reviewed \\nby the RBI in the Monetary Policy Committee every 2 months. If the repo rate is changed by the RBI in month 1, the interest will be reset in \\nMonth 2 against the revised RLLR at the beginning of Month 2 (by the 7th calendar day of Month 2). If the repo rate is changed by the RBI \\nin month 2, the interest will be reset in Month 3 against the revised RLLR at the beginning of Month 3 (by the 7th calendar day of Month 3)\\n• A revision in rate of interest would typically lead to a revision in the Home Loan tenure, and the EMI would remain constant, \\nhowever, the Bank reserves the right to change the loan EMI/tenor or a combination of both, which will be duly communicated to \\nyou via email or SMS.\\n• The revised loan interest rate will be notiﬁed to you by SMS, or E-mail or letter as per HSBC’s prevailing policy/uni003B however, SMS will \\nbe the preferred mode.\\n• The applicable rate of interest rate on your loan is linked to the RLLR plus the margin (spread).The margin charged to you will not \\nbe increased throughout the tenure of the loan, except on account of deterioration in the credit risk proﬁle of the borrower.\\n• Your Smart LAP/Smart Home account / Smart Home DLOD/Smart LAP DLOD can be used for other regular banking transactions \\n(deposit & withdrawals). Excess funds over and above the EMI parked by you into the account will result in savings on interest as \\nthe account will compute interest only on the net ledger balance on a daily basis. This interest oﬀset enables you to reduce the \\ninterest paid and thereby resulting in a reduced tenure of the loan.\\n• However, in the event the Excess Funds in the Smart LAP/Smart Home/ Smart Home DLOD/Smart LAP DLOD account are more \\nthan the threshold Limit then the Bank will charge Non-utilization/Commitment Fee as mentioned and agreed in the Key Fact \\nStatement.\\n• The Customer acknowledges that the bank has discretion to change Non-utilization/Commitment fee or ‘Threshold Limit’ basis \\ninternal review with prior notiﬁcation to the customer.\\n• Interest payment – The interest will be levied once in a month and will be computed on the daily outstanding ledger balance basis \\nthe actual number of days in the year. This interest amount will be debited to the Smart Loan itself thereby recovering the interest \\ncomponent of the EMI. For interest servicing loans, only interest will be due for payment. If there is excess funds over and above \\nthe EMI in the smart loan then the monthly EMI will be adjusted from the excess funds parked in the account every month, till this \\nexcess balance is fully exhausted. The smart loan will remain Standard till such time that the EMI is being serviced from the excess \\nfunds parked in the account. If the Borrower(s) does not deposit any funds into the smart loan for EMI recovery in a particular \\nmonth, and if the interest debited for the month results in the smart loan ledger balance exceeding the account limit, the account \\nwill be shown as a delinquent account. The normal Interest rate and the overlimit Interest rate on the account will be kept the same \\nprocedurally and no additional (penal) interest will be levied.\\nChanges in the rate of interest\\n• Your ﬂoating interest rate loan is linked to the Repo Linked Lending Rate (RLLR). Any change in the RLLR would also have an \\nimpact on your rate of interest of your loan\\n• A revision in rate of interest would typically lead to a revision in the Home Loan tenure, and the EMI would remain constant, \\nhowever, the Bank reserves the right to change the loan EMI/tenor or a combination of both, which will be duly communicated to \\nyou via email or SMS.\\nHML_MITC_06/25_v1'),\n",

If it continues to remain overdue, then this account shall get tagged as SMA-1 upon \\nrunning day-end process on April 30, 2021 i.e. upon completion of a month of being continuously overdue. Accordingly, the date \\nof SMA-1 classiﬁcation for that account shall be April 30, 2021.\\n Similarly, if the account continues to remain overdue, it shall get tagged as SMA-2 upon running day-end process on May 30, 2021 \\nand if continues to remain overdue further, it shall get classiﬁed as NPA upon running day-end process on June 29, 2021.

Additional conditions applicable to Smart Home and Smart LAP DLOD.\\n1. Smart Home / Smart LAP DLOD: Is a dropline overdraft facility wherein the limit will be equal to the amount disbursed to the \\nborrower(s). The limit is reduced on monthly basis by a minimum of the expected principal payment as per the amortization schedule.\\n2. The Smart Home / Smart LAP DLOD: Has an additional feature of interest save to the borrower(s)/uni003B to operationalize the same,  \\n borrower(s) can park surplus funds in the Smart loan to lower interest. The surplus funds are adjusted towards the Smart loan balance  \\n resulting in interest saves, since the interest calculation for the month considers the day end balance (post adjustment of the surplus  \\n funds). Borrower(s) can withdraw surplus funds from the Smart loan to the extent of the available limit on system (diﬀerence of current  \\n limit and the balance in the Smart Home / Smart LAP DLOD ). Whenever any amount is withdrawn from Smart Home / Smart LAP  \\n DLOD, the outstanding Smart Home / Smart LAP DLOD balance is increased accordingly.\\n3. In under-construction projects where the disbursal is construction-linked and released in tranches, the Smart Home / Smart LAP DLOD  \\n limit will be enhanced as and when the subsequent tranches are disbursed.\\n4.  Repayment account: A Saving Bank account will be opened simultaneously with Smart Home/Smart LAP DLOD. Existing HSBC \\nsaving bank account can also be used, however each Smart Home / Smart LAP DLOD will require a separate savings bank account. \\nAdditionally, borrower(s) authorized standing instruction for an amount equivalent to atleast an EMI will be loaded on the Savings Bank \\naccount to enable monthly credits into the Smart Home/Smart LAP DLOD on or prior EMI cycle date, towards EMI dues. The borrower \\nmay also place a request or authorize a standing instruction for periodic transfer of amount from Smart Home / Smart LAP DLOD to \\nlinked saving bank account.\\n Upon maturity/pre-payment/prior Smart Home/Smart LAP DLOD the linked Saving Bank account will be retained until unless \\nBorrower(s) submits a speciﬁc request to the Bank for closure of Savings Bank account.\\n5.  Equated Monthly Instalment (EMI) and Interest calculation: The EMI for the Smart Home/Smart LAP DLOD is calculated based on \\n372 days in a year (31 days in a month), however the interest will be computed on the daily outstanding ledger balance basis the actual \\nnumber of days in the year. The principal amount will be the diﬀerence between the EMI and the interest amount calculated for the \\nmonth. This approach implies that the principal component of a Smart Home/Smart LAP DLOD EMI is marginally higher than the \\ninterest component. This higher principal component in the EMI of Smart Home/Smart LAP DLOD results in a faster repayment of the \\nloan. \\n6.  Principal payment: The principal amount (i.e. the amount by which the Smart Home/Smart LAP DLOD limit will drop in a month) will \\nbe the diﬀerence between the EMI and the interest computed for the month. The principal recovery gets accounted in the Smart Home \\n/ Smart LAP DLOD through a monthly drop in the limit by at least the principal component as per the standard amortization schedule. \\nThe drop in the limit may be higher depending on the interest charge applicable for the month. \\n7.  Interest payment: The interest will be levied once in a month and will be computed on the daily outstanding ledger balance basis the \\nactual number of days in the year. This interest amount will be debited to the Smart Home / Smart LAP DLOD itself thereby recovering \\nthe interest component of the EMI. For interest servicing loans (under-construction property), only interest will be due for payment till \\nthe time property is completed, or upto 3 years from the date of disbursement of the ﬁrst tranche, whichever occurs earlier. \\nHML_MITC_06/25_v1'),\n",

Excess funds: Borrower(s) shall park funds in the Smart Home / Smart LAP DLOD upto the prevailing Smart Home / Smart LAP DLOD \\nlimit only. Maintaining funds over and above the prevailing Smart Home / Smart LAP DLOD limit leads to a credit balance in the DLOD \\naccount on which no interest saves/beneﬁt will be provided.

Interest\\n• On a monthly basis, you would be required to repay the principal amount of the loan and interest on the loan at the rate as set out \\nin the agreement.\\n• Interest on your loan accrues on a daily basis on the total outstanding balance on that day, and is compounded and will be payable \\nmonthly on EMI dates as mentioned in point No 4 herein.\\n• If your Equated Monthly Instalment (EMI) date falls on a Sunday/public holiday, your interest will be calculated inclusive of that \\nday and debited on the next working day.\\n• The interest rate on the Floating Rate Loan which is linked to HSBC’s published Repo Linked Lending Rate (RLLR) will undergo \\nre-pricing (i.e. upwards or downwards as the case may be) in line with the movement of the RLLR. Repo rate is normally reviewed \\nby the Monetary Policy Committee at intervals of two months. In case of change in Policy Repo Rate, RLLR will be changed in the \\nbeginning of the following month (by 7th calendar day of the following month). Consequent upon any change in RLLR, the rate of \\ninterest of loans linked to RLLR will undergo a change. The RLLR is published by HSBC at the beginning of every month, which \\nwill be the benchmark rate for loans that are disbursed in that month.\\n• The ﬂoating rate of interest on all the loans linked to RLLR disbursed by HSBC will be reset on the month following the \\nannouncement by RBI on change of policy repo rate. The reset will be done by the 7th calendar day of the month. (refer to the \\nexample below).\\nExample:\\nA RLLR Linked Home Loan disbursed during Month 1 will be benchmarked against the RLLR of Month 1. The policy repo rate is reviewed \\nby the RBI in the Monetary Policy Committee every 2 months. If the repo rate is changed by the RBI in month 1, the interest will be reset in \\nMonth 2 against the revised RLLR at the beginning of Month 2 (by the 7th calendar day of Month 2). If the repo rate is changed by the RBI \\nin month 2, the interest will be reset in Month 3 against the revised RLLR at the beginning of Month 3 (by the 7th calendar day of Month 3)\\n• A revision in rate of interest would typically lead to a revision in the Home Loan tenure, and the EMI would remain constant, \\nhowever, the Bank reserves the right to change the loan EMI/tenor or a combination of both, which will be duly communicated to \\nyou via email or SMS.\\n• The revised loan interest rate will be notiﬁed to you by SMS, or E-mail or letter as per HSBC’s prevailing policy/uni003B however, SMS will \\nbe the preferred mode.\\n• The applicable rate of interest rate on your loan is linked to the RLLR plus the margin (spread).The margin charged to you will not \\nbe increased throughout the tenure of the loan, except on account of deterioration in the credit risk proﬁle of the borrower.\\n• Your Smart LAP/Smart Home account / Smart Home DLOD/Smart LAP DLOD can be used for other regular banking transactions \\n(deposit & withdrawals). Excess funds over and above the EMI parked by you into the account will result in savings on interest as \\nthe account will compute interest only on the net ledger balance on a daily basis. This interest oﬀset enables you to reduce the \\ninterest paid and thereby resulting in a reduced tenure of the loan.\\n• However, in the event the Excess Funds in the Smart LAP/Smart Home/ Smart Home DLOD/Smart LAP DLOD account are more \\nthan the threshold Limit then the Bank will charge Non-utilization/Commitment Fee as mentioned and agreed in the Key Fact \\nStatement.\\n• The Customer acknowledges that the bank has discretion to change Non-utilization/Commitment fee or ‘Threshold Limit’ basis \\ninternal review with prior notiﬁcation to the customer.\\n• Interest payment – The interest will be levied once in a month and will be computed on the daily outstanding ledger balance basis \\nthe actual number of days in the year. This interest amount will be debited to the Smart Loan itself thereby recovering the interest \\ncomponent of the EMI. For interest servicing loans, only interest will be due for payment. If there is excess funds over and above \\nthe EMI in the smart loan then the monthly EMI will be adjusted from the excess funds parked in the account every month, till this \\nexcess balance is fully exhausted. The smart loan will remain Standard till such time that the EMI is being serviced from the excess \\nfunds parked in the account. If the Borrower(s) does not deposit any funds into the smart loan for EMI recovery in a particular \\nmonth, and if the interest debited for the month results in the smart loan ledger balance exceeding the account limit, the account \\nwill be shown as a delinquent account. The normal Interest rate and the overlimit Interest rate on the account will be kept the same \\nprocedurally and no additional (penal) interest will be levied.\\nChanges in the rate of interest\\n• Your ﬂoating interest rate loan is linked to the Repo Linked Lending Rate (RLLR).

Additional conditions applicable to Smart Home and Smart LAP DLOD.\\n1. Smart Home / Smart LAP DLOD: Is a dropline overdraft facility wherein the limit will be equal to the amount disbursed to the \\nborrower(s). The limit is reduced on monthly basis by a minimum of the expected principal payment as per the amortization schedule.\\n2. The Smart Home / Smart LAP DLOD: Has an additional feature of interest save to the borrower(s)/uni003B to operationalize the same,  \\n borrower(s) can park surplus funds in the Smart loan to lower interest. The surplus funds are adjusted towards the Smart loan balance  \\n resulting in interest saves, since the interest calculation for the month considers the day end balance (post adjustment of the surplus  \\n funds). Borrower(s) can withdraw surplus funds from the Smart loan to the extent of the available limit on system (diﬀerence of current  \\n limit and the balance in the Smart Home / Smart LAP DLOD ). Whenever any amount is withdrawn from Smart Home / Smart LAP  \\n DLOD, the outstanding Smart Home / Smart LAP DLOD balance is increased accordingly.\\n3. In under-construction projects where the disbursal is construction-linked and released in tranches, the Smart Home / Smart LAP DLOD  \\n limit will be enhanced as and when the subsequent tranches are disbursed.\\n4.  Repayment account: A Saving Bank account will be opened simultaneously with Smart Home/Smart LAP DLOD. Existing HSBC \\nsaving bank account can also be used, however each Smart Home / Smart LAP DLOD will require a separate savings bank account. \\nAdditionally, borrower(s) authorized standing instruction for an amount equivalent to atleast an EMI will be loaded on the Savings Bank \\naccount to enable monthly credits into the Smart Home/Smart LAP DLOD on or prior EMI cycle date, towards EMI dues. The borrower \\nmay also place a request or authorize a standing instruction for periodic transfer of amount from Smart Home / Smart LAP DLOD to \\nlinked saving bank account.\\n Upon maturity/pre-payment/prior Smart Home/Smart LAP DLOD the linked Saving Bank account will be retained until unless \\nBorrower(s) submits a speciﬁc request to the Bank for closure of Savings Bank account.\\n5.  Equated Monthly Instalment (EMI) and Interest calculation: The EMI for the Smart Home/Smart LAP DLOD is calculated based on \\n372 days in a year (31 days in a month), however the interest will be computed on the daily outstanding ledger balance basis the actual \\nnumber of days in the year. The principal amount will be the diﬀerence between the EMI and the interest amount calculated for the \\nmonth. This approach implies that the principal component of a Smart Home/Smart LAP DLOD EMI is marginally higher than the \\ninterest component. This higher principal component in the EMI of Smart Home/Smart LAP DLOD results in a faster repayment of the \\nloan. \\n6.  Principal payment: The principal amount (i.e. the amount by which the Smart Home/Smart LAP DLOD limit will drop in a month) will \\nbe the diﬀerence between the EMI and the interest computed for the month. The principal recovery gets accounted in the Smart Home \\n/ Smart LAP DLOD through a monthly drop in the limit by at least the principal component as per the standard amortization schedule. \\nThe drop in the limit may be higher depending on the interest charge applicable for the month. \\n7.  Interest payment: The interest will be levied once in a month and will be computed on the daily outstanding ledger balance basis the \\nactual number of days in the year. This interest amount will be debited to the Smart Home / Smart LAP DLOD itself thereby recovering \\nthe interest component of the EMI. For interest servicing loans (under-construction property), only interest will be due for payment till \\nthe time property is completed, or upto 3 years from the date of disbursement of the ﬁrst tranche, whichever occurs earlier. \\nHML_MITC_06/25_v1'),\n",

Pre-payment: Borrower(s) has an option of prepaying the facility partially or in full by approaching any of the Bank’s service channels. \\nBorrower(s) can request a pre-payment by depositing the amount in the Savings Bank account or by requesting for the available balance \\nin the Smart Home DLOD to be adjusted towards partial or full pre-payment of the Smart Home / Smart LAP DLOD. Any shortfall during \\nclosure will be recovered from the Savings Bank account, subject to availability of clear balance. Once the pre-payment is eﬀected, the \\nSmart Home / Smart LAP DLOD limit will reduce permanently. In case excess funds are received towards the Smart Home / Smart LAP \\nDLOD without any written instruction to pre-pay, the amount will be credited to the Smart Home account which will impact the available \\nbalance in the account.\\n Notwithstanding anything contained herein above, in the event the excess funds in the Smart Home / Smart LAP DLOD account exceeds \\nthe ‘Threshold Limit’ then the Bank may charge Non-utilization/Commitment fee as detailed in the ‘Tariﬀ sheet’ section above, which will \\nbe subject to normal procedures of loan interest compounding.
